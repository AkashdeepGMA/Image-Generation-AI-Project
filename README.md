# Image-Generation-AI-Project
I developed an Image Generation AI project during the Harvard Advanced AI Bootcamp using a Hugging Face model. The system generates high-quality images from text prompts through advanced transformer-based architectures. This project strengthened my skills in generative AI, model fine-tuning, and creative visual synthesis.
